ARCHIVE CONTENTS

The data contained in this archive are the final version of GPWv3, and
should be used instead of the previous (alpha, beta) versions.

This archive contains population densities, both UN-adjusted and unadjusted, 
in ArcInfo GRID format. The raster data are at 2.5 arc-minutes resolution and 
contain the following data:

ds90g	population densities in 1990, unadjusted, persons per square km
ds90ag	population densities in 1990, adjusted to match UN totals, persons per square km
ds95g	population densities in 1995, unadjusted, persons per square km
ds95ag	population densities in 1995, adjusted to match UN totals, persons per square km
ds00g	population densities in 2000, unadjusted, persons per square km
ds00ag	population densities in 2000, adjusted to match UN totals, persons per square km

All densities are in persons per square kilometer.

The ArcInfo GRID format is intended for use with software that can read this
ESRI format, such as ArcView or ArcMap with the Spatial Analyst extension, 
or other non-ESRI software that supports read (e.g., access through GDAL 
libraries). For other software packages ASCII and BIL formats are available
via http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/gpw.

The data are stored in geographic coordinates of decimal degrees based 
on the World Geodetic System spheroid of 1984 (WGS84).
